# COMP4641 Homework1 Problem3


Given a adjacency matrix of some undirected graph,thish python program will perform the following two functions:
(a) Implements the Girvan-Newman algorithm and outputs the resultant hierarchical decomposition of the network. If there are multiple edges have the same highest betweenness score, remove all of them simultaneously.
(b) Implements the calculation of modularity, and outputs the corresponding cluster structure.
